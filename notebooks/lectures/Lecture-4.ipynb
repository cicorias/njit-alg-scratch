We gave a few examples, but it is worth seeing how this can be coded up. So, I will define below a myDictionary class. To avoid complicating the code, I will assume we are only inserting keys, and no values. \n","\n","As you can see this particular implementation takes as input the size of the dictionary. The native dictionaries in Python do not need such an argument. You can initiate a dictionary and keep inserting new keys. Internally, the language keeps track of the size of the current dictionary, and whenever the number of inserted keys reaches a certain size, then Python starts a new larger dictionary and re-inserts all elements. This is called **re-hashing**. Re-hashing with a different hashing function may be also used if the number of collisions in some address have exceeded a certain bound.
