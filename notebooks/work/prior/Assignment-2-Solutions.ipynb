For the coding you are encouraged to work with Python, even if it is not your favorite language, because it will likely prepare you for future courses or professional requirements. If you do work with Python, you will be required to deliver a notebook similar to this one (you can actually take this and work on it directly). If you work with another language you will be required to return a link to a [repl.it](https://repl.it/), where any text will be in the form of comments. During the week, I will give you more information about how to upload your work. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-d604ucx7LtF","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### **Q1.
