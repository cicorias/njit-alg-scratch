Complete and fancify myHash**\n","\n","**(a)** The implementation of *myHash* class in the lecture notes omits the operation of key deletion. In a code cell below, provide an implementation. In that you can use the *del* operation provided by Python. \n","\n","**(b)** The implementation of *myHash* uses a simple hashing function, which remains the same for every new instance of a dictionary. We discussed though that it makes sense to use a **random** hashing function, in order to beat systematic patterns. Here you are asked to substitute with another fancier hashing function $H(m)$ , which has better properties with respect to real data. In particular, let:\n","\n","$ H(m) = m$^$ r~mod~n$\n","\n","where $r$ is a random integer, $^$ is the bit-wise XOR operation (which you can lookup online). \n","\n","Include this $H(m)$ in the code of myHash. \n","\n","**(c)** Give a sequence of 5 inserts that would cause all inserts to collide under the standard hashing function. How many collisions do you get for the first random number r you tried for the fancy function. \n","\n","**(d)** For the same $r$ as above, find 6 inserts that will cause 6 collisions, using trial and error with the code.
