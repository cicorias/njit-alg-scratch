A task scheduling problem** ###\n","\n","The input for this problem is a set of $n$ tasks. Task $i$ has a start time and and end time $(s_i, t_i)$. The goal is to complete the **maximum possible number of tasks** under this constraint: if we choose to perform some task $i$, then no other task that overlaps with it can be performed. Or in other words, if a task starts or ends between $s_i$ and $t_i$, then it cannot be performed. \n","\n","**(i)** For this problem you should give an algorithm that returns a set of tasks whose number is the maximum possible that can be performed. You should target a algorithm that keeps augmenting a list of tasks by a simple 'greedy' criterion. Please describe your algorithm in text cell.  \n","\n","**(ii)** You should also give an implementation of the algorithm.

A Heap with composite values**\n","\n","**(i)** The heap class we discussed in lecture 2 implicitly assumes that the heap stores only **keys** (numbers). However, as we discussed, we may want to store composite elements that contain values along with the keys. In this question you are asked to modify the following implementation of the class in order to handle elements that are assumed to have a special **key** field. You can demonstrate this on the *heapInsert* function -- the max extraction function will be very similar. \n","\n","**(ii)** You can see Lecture-3 notebook to see how part (i) is done when the data structure is a simple list. This list was used for a suboptimal implementation of Prim's MST algorithm. Assuming you have a modified class from part (i), how would you modify Prim's implementation in order to get an $O(n \\log n)$ running time?
