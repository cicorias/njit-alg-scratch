Implement a Union-Find Data Structure**  ###\n","\n","In lecture 6 we discussed Union-Find Data structures. The lecture was based on these [slides](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos226/lectures/01UnionFind.pdf). The slides contain Java code fo the Union-Find operations. For this assignment you should implement a Python class that implements a Union-Find Data Structure that uses weighting and path compression. Essentially this amounts to translating the code in the slides using the same specifications. Make sure you review the material and understand what the code does, and how it works. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5UMkl0gAtuU0","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595185939918,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":229,"user":{"displayName":"Ioannis Koutis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj88YMRorz6z0Tz4baGdAALRkI2fBVTEWi0XdKh8A=s64","userId":"17239720917701380808"}}},"source":["# your implementation goes here\n","\n","class UnionFind:\n","  \n","  def __init__(self, n):\n","    self.id = list(range(n))\n","    self.sz = [1]*n\n","\n","  def root(self,i):\n","    while (i != self.id[i]): \n","      id[i] = id[id[i]];       #this is for path compression\n","      i = self.id[i]\n","\n","    return i\n","\n","  def find(self,p,q):\n","    return (self.root(p) == self.root(q))\n","\n","  def unite(self,p,q):\n","    i = self.root(p)\n","    j = self.root(q)\n","\n","    # weighted version\n","    if self.sz[i]<self.sz[j]:\n","      self.id[i] = j\n","      self.sz[j] = self.sz[j]+self.sz[i]\n","    else:\n","      self.id[j] = i\n","      self.sz[i] = self.sz[i]+self.sz[j]\n","\n","\n"],"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iJUSKoIzb-tn","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":107},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595185953975,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":400,"user":{"displayName":"Ioannis Koutis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj88YMRorz6z0Tz4baGdAALRkI2fBVTEWi0XdKh8A=s64","userId":"17239720917701380808"}},"outputId":"b16d325f-2cbe-465a-a68c-ac6d59206810"},"source":["S = UnionFind(5)\n","print(S.id)\n","print(S.sz)\n","\n","print(S.find(3,2))\n","\n","S.unite(3,2)\n","\n","print(S.id)\n","print(S.sz)"],"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n","False\n","[0, 1, 3, 3, 4]\n","[1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"duqXrslqqa3X","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### **Q2.
