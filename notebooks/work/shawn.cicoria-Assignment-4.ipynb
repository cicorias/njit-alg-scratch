    "\n",
    "**(b)** The implementation of *myHeap* uses a simple hashing function, which remains the same for every new instance of a dictionary. We discussed though that it makes sense to use a **random** hashing function, in order to beat systematic patterns. Here you are asked to substitute with another fancier hashing function $H(m)$ , which has better properties with respect to real data. In particular, let:\n",
