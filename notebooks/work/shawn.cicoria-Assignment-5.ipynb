Implement a Union-Find Data Structure**  ###\n","\n","In lecture 6 we discussed Union-Find Data structures. The lecture was based on these [slides](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos226/lectures/01UnionFind.pdf). The slides contain Java code fo the Union-Find operations. For this assignment you should implement a Python class that implements a Union-Find Data Structure that uses weighting and path compression. Essentially this amounts to translating the code in the slides using the same specifications. Make sure you review the material and understand what the code does, and how it works. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5UMkl0gAtuU0","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"tags":[]},"source":["# your implementation goes here\n","import unittest\n","\n","class UnionFind():\n","    def __init__(self, N):\n","        self._id = list(range(N))\n","        self._sz = [1] * N  # size in num of node children\n","\n","    def find(self, p: int, q: int) -> bool:\n","        return self.root(p) == self.root(q)\n","\n","    def root(self, i: int) -> int:\n","        j = i\n","        while (j != self._id[j]):\n","            self._id[j] = self._id[self._id[j]]\n","            j = self._id[j]\n","        return j\n","\n","    def unite(self, p: int, q: int):\n","        i = self.root(p)\n","        j = self.root(q)\n","        if i == j:\n","            return\n","        if self._sz[i] < self._sz[j]:\n","            self._id[i] = j\n","            self._sz[j] += self._sz[i]\n","        else:\n","            self._id[j] = i\n","            self._sz[i] += self._sz[j]\n","\n","\n","class basic_tests(unittest.TestCase):\n","    def test_init(self):\n","        uf = UnionFind(5)\n","\n","        self.assertListEqual([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], uf._id)\n","\n","    def test_find(self):\n","        uf = UnionFind(10)\n","\n","        self.assertEqual(uf.find(5, 5), True)\n","        self.assertEqual(uf.find(5, 4), False)\n","\n","    def test_unite_1(self):\n","        iv = [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n","        exp = [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3]\n","\n","        uf = UnionFind(10)\n","        uf._id = iv\n","\n","        uf.unite(4, 9)\n","\n","        self.assertListEqual(uf._id, exp)\n","\n","    def test_all_1(self):\n","        uf = UnionFind(10)\n","        #  use the sample from orig pdf on p33 https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/AlgsDS07/01UnionFind.pdf\n","        for (p, q) in [(3, 4), (4, 9), (8, 0), (2, 3), (5, 6), (5, 9), (7, 3), (4, 8), (6, 1)]:\n","            uf.unite(p, q)\n","\n","        self.assertListEqual(uf._id, [8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3])\n","\n","        rv = uf.find(0, 1)\n","        self.assertTrue(rv)\n","        self.assertListEqual(uf._id, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3])\n","\n","#if __name__ == '__main__':\n","#    unittest.main(verbosity=1)\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    unittest.main(argv=['first-arg-is-ignored'], exit=False)\n","    # unittest.main(verbosity=1)\n"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":"....\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 4 tests in 0.003s\n\nOK\n"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"duqXrslqqa3X","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### **Q2.
